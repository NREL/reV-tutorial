reV in the Cloud
===

### Start with the existing material in the reV docs:
https://nrel.github.io/reV/misc/examples.aws_pcluster.html

### Things to do:
-  Build off of reV maintenance task #3: reV tutorial material
        - This will largely include guides and examples of data access/building
        - “Now that you understand how reV, here are considerations for setting up your remote server.”
        - Setup example
        - Transferring data
        - Configuring your instance
            - Purchasing an instance (Digital Ocean, AWS, etc.)
            - Minimum specs for a local, regional, and national (Memory, storage, cpu, etc).
            - Cost estimates (Perhaps recycle some of Grant’s work here).
- Double check Grant's cost estimates/update for new functionality (e.g., Bespoke)
