Transmission data (Under Construction)
===

Things to do
===
- Here, we just want to describe what the transmission data looks like
  - i.e., its a lookup table with costs and distances associated with all available connections for a reV-supply-curve-aggregation table.
- Describe the different optionsL
  - i.e., straighline and least-cost path (with links to reV/reVX where appropriate)
- Point to Paul's tutorials (done.)
