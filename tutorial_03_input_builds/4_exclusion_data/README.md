Build exclusion data
===
This folder introduces you how to build reV-compatible high resolution 
land-use `HDF5` datasets used for exclusions and characterizations.


Things to do
===
Describe generally what the format is (An HDF5 collection of arrays with attribute information)
Describe how you start with GeoTiffs
The data in the GeoTiff can represent anything, you'll handle how to interpret the values
  in a later configuration file
Describe how reVX already has methods that handle the conversion and link to it.
Also describe how you can any number of descriptive attributes to each dataset using H5py (creation date, source, citation, etc.)
