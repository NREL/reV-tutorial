reV pipeline
===========================

An example reV pipeline command that executes the following modules in order: 
    - `reV generation`: generates energy profiles through SAM simulations. 
    - `reV multi-year`: combines generations in multiple years into a single multi-year file
    - `reV qa-qc`: conducts a QA/QC that performs quality assurance checks on the `reV` pipeline outputs.
