# Draft outline for a video tutorial series on reV.

The goal of the videos will be to provide new users an overview of what reV is and does, to teach key concepts such as technical potential, and to step through the technical details of implementing a model run. We could progress either via an increasing complexity strategy or by reV module. 

We would like the videos to cycle between a concepts view (digital chalk board, physical white board, or something similar) and screenshares of the computer work required.


## Initial Proposed Videos:
    
    #1: Technical Potential and The Renewable Energy Potential Model
        - Define technical potential, contextualize this assessment in the broader energy space, how its used, 
          who uses it, what it looks like, etc.
        - Introduce reV, its purpose, and how it can be used to model technical potential.
    
    #2: Setting up a reV environment.

    #3: Getting/Making reV Inputs
    
    #4: Running the model: Generation Modules 1
        - SAM
        - Generation Module
    
    #5: Running the model: Generation Modules 2
        - Collect
        - Multi-year
        - etc.
    
    #6: Running the model: Aggregation Module
    
    #7: Running the model: Supply Curve Module
    
    #8: Running the model: Representative Profiles Module
    
    #9: Scaling up model runs
        - Execution control
        - AWS
        - HSDS
    
    #10: Other reV-related packages
        - rex
        - reVX
        - NRWAL
        - gaps
    
    #11: Advanced reV modeling
        - Bespoke
        - Least-cost Transmission
        - BOS
        - etc.
