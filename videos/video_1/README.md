# Outline for a video tutorial series - Episode #1

## Introducing the reV Model and Defining Technical Potential
- Introduce ourselves,  who we are, where we work, and what we do
- One of the main responsibility of GDS is the reV model, which is why you're here, etc.
- Before talk about the model, we need introduce the idea of technical potential
    - Define tech pot.
    - Contextualize in terms of broader energy availability assessment (e.g., geological surveys in the Oil and Gas industry)
    - Ideally, we'll convince Galen or Donna or Anthony to make a guest appearance and describe their thought process when they developed the technical potential analysis approach...this could also lead directly into the Model
- Introduce the reV model
    - Why's it called reV
    - How speciifcally does the model represent technical potential (e.g., what are the outputs.)
    - How does this model fit into the broader energy modeling ecosystem at NREL.
    - Describe the open-source nature of reV...anyone can use it, though challenges exists in acquiring and/or building input datasets, which we'll over in Episode #3.
    - Describe who all is using it.
- Preview the next episode.
    - Tell the viewers that we'll start setting up the model in the next episode
