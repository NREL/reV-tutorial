# Outline for a video tutorial series - Episode #1

## Introducing the reV Model and Defining Technical Potential
- Introduce ourselves, who we are, where we work, and what we do
- One of the main responsibility of GDS is the reV model, which is why you're here, etc.
- Before talk about the model, we need introduce the idea of technical potential
    - Define tech pot (reV 2019 & reV 2023 reports).
        - Technical potential is a measure of resource potential (i.e., capacity) that could be developed based on assumptions of the developable land area defined by the user; in other words, how much renewable energy capacity could be developed in a given land area after accounting for land exclusions predefined by the user. 
        - For example, the user can limit development by land ownership, terrain, land use/cover, and urban areas, as well as other custom inputs.
        - It is calculated as a function of the available land area after applying exclusions, the net capacity factor estimated by the generation module, and a user-defined power density appropriate for the specific technology. The power density value represents the maximum potential capacity for a given unit of area (e.g., MW/km2). 
        
    - Contextualize in terms of broader energy availability assessment (e.g., geological surveys in the Oil and Gas industry; https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=17151)
        - Geological surveys are conducted in the oil and gas industries to assess the available total resources underground, which referred to as the in-place resources. The tech pot in renewable energy has a similar definition to the in-place resources in the oil and gas industry, where we are measuring the maximum available energy after applying exclusions and contraints. 

    - Ideally, we'll convince Galen or Donna or Anthony to make a guest appearance and describe their thought process when they developed the technical potential analysis approach...this could also lead directly into the Model

- Introduce the reV model
    - Why's it called reV
    - How speciifcally does the model represent technical potential (e.g., what are the outputs.)
    - How does this model fit into the broader energy modeling ecosystem at NREL.
    - Describe the open-source nature of reV...anyone can use it, though challenges exists in acquiring and/or building input datasets, which we'll over in Episode #3.
    - Describe who all is using it.
- Preview the next episode.
    - Tell the viewers that we'll start setting up the model in the next episode
